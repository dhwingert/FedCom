# FedCom

FedCom is a player turn tracking app.  It helps players keep track of who moves when in the following tabletop games.

 - Starfleet Battles
 - Champions
 - Dungeons & Dragons
 - Federation Commander (not finished)

This is a work in progress.  The main purpose of this project was to teach myself Android programming.
